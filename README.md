# Sentiment Analysis in Video Game Reviews

Sentiment analysis is a field of machine learning that is extremely intriguing to me. The ability to convert words, no matter how simple or complex, to numerical data is truly amazing. In my project, I conducted sentiment analysis on a variety of video game reviews in order to determine whether a video game was recommended or not.

### Why is this important?

User ratings, for instance, on a 1 to 5 scale, can generally determine how good or bad a video game is. However, analyzing text can illustrate specific terms or phrases linked to a video game's rating. For example, the words "beautiful", "visual", and "breathtaking" would be associated with positive reviews, and developers could infer that their game is highly praised for its graphics, and may advertise this aspect of the game more. On the other hand, if words like "clunky", "awkward", and "movement" were associated with negative reviews, developers would assume that their game struggles with its controls, and should be addressed in an update. Without text, we could not gain this insight at all.
